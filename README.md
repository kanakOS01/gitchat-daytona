# Sample Streamlit with OpenAI & Weaviate

Git Chat is a RAG application that allows you to have a q/a session with any github repository of your choice. This is especially helpful for beginners who find it difficult to understand complex open source code bases on github.

It uses [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/docs/) for managing environment, [weaviate cloud vector database](https://weaviate.io/) to store the embeddings, [LangChain with OpenAI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/) for llm models and facilitate queries with context and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for UI.
